# Baking App

In this project, I created an app to view video recipes. 
I handled media loading, verified user interfaces with UI tests, 
and integrated third party libraries. I also provided a complete user 
experience with a home screen widget.

## Why this Project
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement 
apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you 
need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies
where I had an implementation guide, it was up to myself to figure things out for 
the Baking App.

## What I Learned?

In this project I learned:

-Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.

-Handle error cases in Android.

-Add a widget to my app experience.

-Leverage a third-party library in my app.

-Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
